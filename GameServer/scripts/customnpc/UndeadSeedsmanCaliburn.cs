/* 04/02/08 
 * Merec: On live servers there were 4 Rows with 5 trees in it.
 * seedsman do not stop planting if somone killed a tree.
 * replaced switch-case sections.
 * tree-locations are now /loc instead of /gloc coordinates
 * 
 * 03/03/08
 * BluRaven: This is the undead seedsman mob for Albion SI, Avalon Isle.
 * Located at: X: 484850  Y: 487251   Z: 3098   Region: 51, Avalon Isle.
 * There are a total of 24 tree's, in 3 rows.  Once *ALL* tree's are
 * killed by players, he will replant them all.  If a player kills a tree
 * while he is replanting, he will abort replanting and wait again for
 * *ALL* tree's to be killed before he tries to plant them again.
 * Freshly planted trees will start as level 1 seedlings, then grow to
 * their adult size and level at a random interval. (Live like!)
 * Thanks to Graveen & Dinberg for helping me with this script
 * and to the DOL staff and community that contributes to DOL! =)
 * PS: I've done my best to bugtest this script, but if you find any bugs
 * besure to send me a PM.  Feel free to make changes to
 * it but if you do, please share it with the community.
 * Thanks to Merec for his nice changes.
 * 
 * TO USE:
 * Place this script inside your release/scripts folder and restart
 * your server.  The seedsman is automatically started/created when
 * the server starts up.  He is not saved in the database, and the
 * tree's are not saved either.  They are made every time by this script.
 * 
 * Optional:
 * You can change the walk speed to make planting/moving slower/faster.
 * Just edit the WalkSpeed in this script.  Also you can change the
 * locations of the tree's or his 5 random walk spots (by editing).
 * 
 * TODO:
 * 
 * Use exact locations from live. [done by Merec]
